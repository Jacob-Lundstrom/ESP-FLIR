# ESP-FLIR
 Basic implementation of an interface between a generic ESP-WROOM-32 dev module and a FLIR Lepton 3.5 with it's respsective dev board using the Arduino IDE.

 Arduino is horrible for anything higher level than blinking LEDs or turning relays on and off. I will likely not finish this project simply because of how horrible the development experience has been.
 The hard part (Getting a single VOSPI image) is done though, so if you'd like to work on this and implement a better image collection method or video stream, be my guest!
